# 🎶 Golden Tune Jukebox

**Golden Tune** is a DIY connected jukebox project built around a Raspberry Pi, addressable LEDs and a custom 3D-printed enclosure. It combines **hardware, software and 3D design** to create a retro-inspired jukebox with a modern twist.

This repository contains **all the technical documentation** needed to understand, build and customize the project.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Golden Tune Jukebox includes:
- A **Raspberry Pi** running the main software
- A **5” HDMI touchscreen**
- **WS2812B addressable LEDs** with custom animations
- A **rotary encoder** for user interaction
- A **USB speaker**
- A fully **3D-printed enclosure** designed for this project

The project is split into **three main parts**: software, electronics, and physical assembly.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer – Please Read

This is **not a beginner project**.

Building the Golden Tune Jukebox requires:
- Basic to intermediate **electronics knowledge**
- Confidence with **Raspberry Pi & Linux**
- Ability to read wiring diagrams
- Experience with **soldering and 3D printing**
- Debugging skills (both hardware and software)

⚠️ **Build at your own risk.**  
I provide documentation and examples, but:
- I cannot guarantee compatibility with all hardware variants
- I cannot provide step-by-step personal support to everyone
- I may not have time to answer all individual questions

If you choose to build this project, you are responsible for:
- Electrical safety
- Correct wiring
- Component selection
- Final assembly and testing
